# Exchange Server Quarterly Servicing updates, changes, zero day vulnerability fixes released

Yesterday we released Exchange Server quarterly servicing Cumulative Updates (for Exchange 2013/2016/2019) and Rollup Update (for Exchange 2010) for all supported versions of Exchange Server.

Few highlights were,

  - These updates have the fixes to mitigate the zero day and related vulnerabilities.
  - An architectural change to EWS Push notification authentication – this change addresses the EWS Vulnerability. 

<!-- end list -->

  - [KB4490060](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4490060) outlines the details of the changes made.
  - Customers who rely upon Push Notifications, should understand the important changes made.
  - EWS Pull and Streaming Notifications functionality are unchanged by today’s updates.
  - The change in Push Notification authentication is a permanent change to the product and necessary to protect the security of an Exchange Server.

The Exchange team has determined a change in the Active Directory rights granted to Exchange Servers using the default [Shared Permissions Model](https://docs.microsoft.com/exchange/configure-exchange-2013-for-shared-permissions-exchange-2013-help) is in order.

  - Changes in the latest cumulative updates, described in [KB4490059](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/4490059), reduce the scope of objects where Exchange is able to write security descriptors in the directory.

Exchange Server 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 all receive an update package.
