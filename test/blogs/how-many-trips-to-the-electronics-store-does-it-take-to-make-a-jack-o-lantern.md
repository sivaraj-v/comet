# How many trips to the electronics store does it take to make a Jack O' lantern?

How many trips to the electronic store does it take to make a Jack O' Lantern? Well it turns out a lot more than we thought\! John Leier (Technical Product Manager for the .NET MF) and I took on the task of making up some Jack O' Lantern for the Microsoft booth at [Maker Faire](http://www.makerfaire.com) in Austin this weekend. We figured, "what the heck" a few blinky lights will be no problem"... So we headed out to the local Radio Shack to get some LEDs transistors, resistors and related supplies. Unfortunately the days where you can buy a moderate quantity of individual components in an electronics shop have long since gone. We had to travel to at least 4 places to get all the supplies we needed for the pumpkins and a few other projects we want to show at the faire. But we got everything we needed eventually. (Gotta love a GPS that can find all the stores and tell me how to get to them from where I am\!)

So, what sort of patterns should we carve into our pumpkins?
