# Azure architecture icons

Customers and partners are permitted by Microsoft to use the Azure icons to create architecture diagrams. They are designed as a family and are simple and accessible. The icons can also be used in training manuals or documentation about a Microsoft product. The full name of the icon must always be used in proximity to the icon, but never locked to appear like a logo.

### Do’s

* Use the icon to illustrate how products can work together
* In diagrams, make sure to include the product name somewhere close to the icon
* In text, at first mention use the full product name:  Microsoft Azure (insert name)

### Don’ts

* Never put the product name so close to the icon that it appears to be a logo
* Don’t crop, flip or rotate icons
* Don’t distort or change icon shape in any way
* Don’t use Microsoft product icons to represent your product or service

### Use terms specific to Microsoft Azure icons

You may use icons in architectural diagrams, training manuals or documentation about Azure. The use of the icon must be specific to the function of the icon within Azure.
