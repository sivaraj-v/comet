      - question: What is the Microsoft commercial marketplace?
        answer: |
          The commercial marketplace connects business and government agencies with solutions built by our partners. Our partners create and manage offers in Partner Center, and customers can discover and buy solutions through in-product experiences, such as Microsoft AppSource, Azure Marketplace, resellers in the Cloud Solution Provider program, and our sales teams through the co-sell program.

          To learn more, go to the [Microsoft commercial marketplace hub](https://partner.microsoft.com/asset/collection/commercial-marketplace#/).
      - question: What's the difference between Microsoft AppSource and Azure Marketplace?
        answer: |
          AppSource includes business and industry solutions, such as apps that integrate into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform services.

          Azure Marketplace includes IT and developer solutions that are built on Azure or used within Azure subscriptions themselves.

          To learn more, go to the [buyer's guide](https://aka.ms/MarketplaceBuyerGuide).
      - question: Why should I make my software or services available in the Microsoft commercial marketplace?
        answer: |
          The commercial marketplace is a starting point for go-to-market collaboration and enablement with sales channels and Marketplace Rewards. The websites and in-product experiences give your products visibility to millions of customers who are seeking solutions like yours. You don't even need to build or buy the commerce capabilities. 

          The commercial marketplace is available in 141 regions, on a per-plan basis. 

          We manage tax payment in many countries/regions, and we provide access to our global channel network of resellers. You can use a customer's Microsoft Customer Agreement or Enterprise Agreement to sell to organizations without having to create a new buying relationship.
