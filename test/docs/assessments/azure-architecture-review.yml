      description: Derive these values by conducting a risk assessment, and make sure you understand the cost and risk of downtime and data loss. These are nonfunctional requirements of a system and should be dictated by business requirements. Recovery time objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable time an application is unavailable after an incident. Recovery point objective (RPO) is the maximum duration of data loss that's acceptable during a disaster. If the MTTR value of *any* critical component in a highly available setup exceeds the system RTO, a failure in the system might cause an unacceptable business disruption. That is, you can't restore the system within the defined RTO.

      description: In Azure, the service level agreements describes Microsoft's commitments for uptime and connectivity. If the SLA for a particular service is 99.9%, you should expect the service to be available 99.9% of the time. Different services have different SLAs. The Azure SLA also includes provisions for obtaining a service credit if the SLA is not met, along with specific definitions of *availability* for each service. That aspect of the SLA acts as an enforcement policy.

      title: Segregated read operations from update operations on your data stores.
      description: In traditional architectures, the same data model is used to query and update a database. That's simple and works well for basic CRUD operations. In more complex applications, however, this approach can become unwieldy. For example, on the read side, the application may perform many different queries, returning data transfer objects (DTOs) with different shapes. Object mapping can become complicated. On the write side, the model may implement complex validation and business logic. As a result, you can end up with an overly complex model that does too much.

      title: Implemented geographic replication for your databases.
      description: If you are using Azure SQL Database there are two types of recovery geo-restore and active geo-replication. Geo restore is also available with Basic, Standard, and Premium databases. It provides the default recovery option when the database is unavailable because of an incident in the region where your database is hosted. Similar to point-in-time restore, geo-restore relies on database backups in geo-redundant Azure storage. It restores from the geo-replicated backup copy, and therefore is resilient to the storage outages in the primary region. Active Geo-replication is available for all database tiers. It’s designed for applications that have more aggressive recovery requirements than geo-restore can offer.  Additionally, a variety of options are available for recovery and high availability for SQL Server 2012 (and later) running in Azure Virtual Machines.

This will enable the system to continue functioning and meet any service level agreements (SLAs) that are in place.

      description: In the cloud, transient faults aren't uncommon and an application should be designed to handle them elegantly and transparently. This minimizes the effects faults can have on the business tasks the application is performing. The retry pattern leverages the fact that these faults are typically self-correcting, and if the action that triggered a fault is repeated after a suitable delay it's likely to be successful.

      title: Have a method of preventing cascading failures.
      description: Failure in one part of the system can lead to cascading failures, resulting in many operations becoming blocked while holding onto critical system resources, such as memory, database connections. The circuit breaker pattern focuses on faults that take longer to fix and thus a retry is often not good enough. In these situations it might be pointless for an application to continually retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed, and instead the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly.

For example, Azure Event Hubs supports failing over to the secondary namespace.

      title: Defined manual responses where automation doesn't exist.
      description: Although automation is ideal, some strategies for disaster recovery require manual responses. Monitor your application for warning signs that may require proactive intervention. For example, if Azure SQL Database or Azure Cosmos DB consistently throttles your application, you might need to increase your database capacity or optimize your queries. Even though the application might handle the throttling errors transparently, your telemetry should still raise an alert so that you can follow up. For service limits and quota thresholds, we recommend configuring alerts on Azure resources metrics and diagnostics logs. When possible, set up alerts on metrics, which are lower latency than diagnostics logs.

      title: Understand what to do when data is corrupted or deleted.
      description: If a data store fails, there might be data inconsistencies when it becomes available again, especially if the data was replicated. Understanding the recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) of replicated data stores can help you predict the amount of data loss. To understand whether the cross-regional failover is started manually or by Microsoft, review the Azure service SLAs. For services with no SLAs for cross-regional failover, Microsoft typically decides when to fail over and usually prioritizes recovery of data in the primary region. If data in the primary region is deemed unrecoverable, Microsoft fails over to the secondary region.

      title: Defined a backup strategy.
      description: Many alternative strategies are available for implementing distributed compute across regions. These must be tailored to the specific business requirements and circumstances of the application. At a high level, the approaches can be divided into the following categories redeploy on disaster, warm spare (Active/Passive), and hot spare (active/active).

      title: Have a resource management strategy.
      description: You can distribute compute instances across regions by creating a separate cloud service in each target region, and then publishing the deployment package to each cloud service. However, distributing traffic across cloud services in different regions must be implemented by the application developer or with a traffic management service. Determining the number of spare role instances to deploy in advance for disaster recovery is an important aspect of capacity planning. Having a full-scale secondary deployment ensures that capacity is already available when needed; however, this effectively doubles the cost. A common pattern is to have a small, secondary deployment, just large enough to run critical services. This small secondary deployment is a good idea, both to reserve capacity, and for testing the configuration of the secondary environment.

      title: Document regional failure plans.
      description: Azure is divided physically and logically into units called regions. A region consists of one or more datacenters in close proximity. Under rare circumstances, it is possible that facilities in an entire region can become inaccessible, for example due to network failures. Or facilities can be lost entirely, for example due to a natural disaster. This section explains the capabilities of Azure for creating applications that are distributed across regions. Such distribution helps to minimize the possibility that a failure in one region could affect other regions.

      description: Failure mode analysis (FMA) is a process for building resiliency into a system, by identifying possible failure points in the system. The FMA should be part of the architecture and design phases, so that you can build failure recovery into the system from the beginning. FMA builds resiliency into a system by identifying possible failure points and defining how the application responds to those failures. The FMA should be part of the architecture and design phases, so failure recovery is built into the system from the beginning. The goals of an FMA are to determine what types of failures an application might experience, capture the potential effects, and plan how best to identify and recover from failures.

      title: Deployed the application across multiple regions.
      description: If your application is deployed to a single region, in the rare event the entire region becomes unavailable, your application will also be unavailable. This may be unacceptable under the terms of your application's SLA. If so, consider deploying your application and its services across multiple regions. A multi-region deployment can use an active-active pattern (distributing requests across multiple active instances) or an active-passive pattern (keeping a "warm" instance in reserve, in case the primary instance fails). Many failures are manageable within the same Azure region. However, in the unlikely event of a region-wide service disruption, the locally redundant copies of your data aren't available. If you've enabled geo-replication, there are three additional copies of your blobs and tables in a different region. If Microsoft declares the region lost, Azure remaps all the DNS entries to the secondary region.

      description: Monitor your application for warning signs that might require proactive intervention. Tools that assess the overall health of the application and its dependencies help you to recognize quickly when a system or its components suddenly become unavailable. Use them to implement an early warning system. Identify the key performance indicators of your application's health, such as transient exceptions and remote call latency. Set thresholds at levels that identify issues before they become critical and require a recovery response. Send an alert to operations when the threshold value is reached.

      description: It's not practical to monitor your application directly, so instrumentation is key. A large-scale distributed system might run on dozens of virtual machines (VMs), which are added and removed over time. Likewise, a cloud application might use a number of data stores and a single user action might span multiple subsystems. Provide rich instrumentation for failures that are likely but have not yet occurred, provide enough data to determine the cause, mitigate the situation, and ensure that the system remains available, for failures that have already occurred, the application should return an appropriate error message to the user but should attempt to continue running, albeit with reduced functionality.

      description: Does your service run seasonally or follow long-term patterns? Some Azure services offer the concept of ‘reserved instances', that can be utilized to yield further cost savings on predictable VM sizes that will be utilized for the solution's components. If these are available, consider purchasing Seasonal/one-off or long term (RIs). Reserved instances are purchased in one-year or three-year terms, with payment required for the full term up front. After purchase, the reservation is matched up to running instances of the same SKU size or same-family SKU sizes and hours from your reservation will be decremented accordingly.

      description: Any architecture planning starts with a careful enumeration of requirements. Architecting a Cloud solution is no different. As with any technology system, requirements are in place to ensure that the needs of the stakeholders are addressed and it is vital to remember that optimal design does not equal the lowest cost design. Cost is another requirement lever that can be adjusted as other requirements dictate, resulting in a scenario of complex tradeoffs between the areas that architects are seeking to optimize for such as security, scalability, resilience and operability. A solution architecture could perfectly address the challenges of these areas, however if the solution costs too much, the business will quickly look for alternate options to reduce cost. In some cases, the cost of not meeting expectations, internal or external, will outweigh the solution cost and the architecture is accepted, whereas in others the risk may be accepted in favor of a cheaper solution architecture.

      title: Spec-ed out the data storage and partitioned it correctly.
      description: Choosing an inappropriate data store or one that is mis-configured can have a huge cost impact on your design and you can save tens of thousands of dollars by getting the data tier correct. Consider storing binary image data, whilst it is certainly possible to store it in Azure SQL Database as a varbinary(MAX) column type, you should strongly consider storing the data in Azure Blob Storage Block Blobs and if your design requires SQL, then store a lookup table in SQL Database, and retrieve the document on the fly to serve it to the user in your application middle tier. This way the majority of your data capacity is consumed with fast, cost-effective blob storage that is a good few orders of magnitude cheaper than Azure SQL Database, but where needed – your use of SQL Database is highly targeted to high speed data lookups and set-based operations, where SQL really shines. This pattern is called polyglot persistence and it doesn't just apply to PaaS services, consider that Azure ‘Hot' Block Blob Storage costs around 1/50 of the cost of the equivalent size of the Premium SSD volume you would be placing the database on, and this model still applies even in an IaaS world.

Do you understand what your Cloud costs usually are? Do you know if there have been significant changes in either the business or the I.T. capabilities that may have contributed to a change in these costs? Make sure you identify which business-related data is relevant to your Cloud cost conversation, to ensure that all aspects are considered. In addition to detailed usage information on your invoice, Azure provides you with tools that surface information such as incurred costs and makes recommendations on cost savings (such as downsizing virtual machines). Nonetheless, it's important to consider building additional custom solutions to fully maximize cost savings where identifiable

So what happens when one of those alerts lands in your Inbox? First, check the current consumption data. Budget alerts do not fire in real time and there may be a delay (up to 8 hrs) between this alert and your current incurred cost actuals. Is there any significant difference between the alert level and what you're seeing now? Then you'll need to gather the appropriate people to discuss the cost trend, possible causes and any required action. That is likely to include people like application owners, who should be clearly identifiable through appropriate resource tagging. Who else do you need to involve (for example, business department owners) to provide the bigger picture of why a budget limit has nearly been reached? Remember this isn't just a systems question – it may also involve taking into account recent business activities which have been unexpectedly high.

      description: Both TCO and ROI are key financial metrics that organizations may wish to quantify for their Cloud investment. In some cases, they are also looking to compare these metrics to existing on-premises equivalents. It can be a challenge to get these figures accurate though, due to several reasons on-premises TCO may not accurately account for ‘hidden' expenses, such as under-utilization of purchased hardware or network maintenance costs (labor & equipment failure). Cloud TCO may not accurately account for a drop in the organization's operational labor hours, due to the Cloud provider's infrastructure or platform management services being included in the cloud service pricing or the additional operational efficiences of cloud tools.

      title: Use different Azure datacenter locations to optimize cost.
      description: Azure has datacenters all over the world and each datacenter is placed within a zone within a region or just a region. Usage costs vary between locations that offer Azure products, services, and resources based on popularity, demand, and local infrastructure costs. Azure also offers differentiated cloud regions for specific security and compliance requirements. For example, you might want to build your Azure solution by provisioning resources in locations that offer the lowest prices, but this would require transferring data between locations if dependent resources and their users are in different parts of the world. If there are meters tracking the volume of data that moves between the resources you provision, any potential savings you make from choosing the cheapest location could be offset by the additional cost of transferring data between those resources.

      title: Track the resource tier and optimize appropriately.
      description: Costs are resource-specific, so the usage that a meter tracks and the number of meters associated with a resource depend on the resource type. The usage that a meter tracks correlates to several billable units. Those are charged to your account for each billing period, and the rate per billable unit depends on the resource type you are using. In some cases, there are also choices to be made about a resource type that impact the pricing, for example choosing to use a Standard HDD hard disk or a Premium SSD hard disk. Resource types will vary in features such as performance or availability, the design implications of which must be considered along with their cost. As a rule of thumb, start small for resources then scale the resource up as needed. For example, it's more cost effective to start with a small size in GB for a managed disk as you are incurring costs on the allocated storage vs. pay-per-GB model. Likewise, with ExpressRoute circuits start with a smaller bandwidth circuit and scale up as needed. In Azure it's generally easier to grow a service with little to no downtime vs. downscale a service, which usually requires deprovisioning or downtime.

      title: Have the right data store to match usage.
      description: Not surprisingly, the overall performance and scale of an application is often heavily weighted on the choice and implementation of the database and the overall data tier of the application. This is because database reads and writes involve a network call and storage IO, both of which are expense operations. Choosing the right database service to store and retrieve data is therefore a critical decision and must be carefully considered to ensure overall application scalability. Azure has many first party database services that will fit most needs. In addition there are a series of 3rd party options that can be considered from Azure Marketplace.

      title: Use dynamic service discovery for microservices applications.
      description: Clients of a service use either Client-side discovery or Server-side discovery to determine the location of a service instance to send requests. Service discovery is a process of figuring out how to connect to a service, and if done correctly, can lead to software that scales out as usage increases. Decomposing an application into microservices is a practice that can directly lead to native scalability given a service's ability to be scaled and updated individually. This level of decoupling is an architectural best practice. However, when many microservices are in play, managing, executing, and operationalizing the services becomes a bottleneck, leading to the incorporation of an orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Service Fabric. Both of these platforms provide built-in services for executing, scaling, and operating a microservices architecture; and one of those key services is discovery and finding where a particular service is running. The client of the service should not need to know or care where the service executes or how many instance of the service are executing. It is the job of the orchestration platform to connect the client to the service through a decoupled discovery services, such as DNS, that major orchestration platforms all provide. The reason incorporating dynamic service discovery can lead to scalability gains is that each service can then be sized independently with multiple instances without the service client having this knowledge or changing its interaction.

      title: Utilize connection pooling.
      description: Establishing connections to databases is typically a very expensive operation that involves establishing an authenticated network connection to the remote database server. Pooling and reusing cached connections for new database operations is a common best practice for improving both application performance and scalability. In many cases, a default pool size might only consist of a small handful of connections that performs quickly in basic test scenarios, but become a bottleneck under scale when the pool is exhausted. Establishing a pool size that maps to the number of concurrent transactions supported on each application instance is a best practice. Each database and application platform will have slightly different requirements for the right way to setup and leverage the pool. In all cases, testing is paramount to ensure a connection pool is properly established and working as designed under load.

      title: Compress data when appropriate.
      description: A well known optimization best practice for scaling web applications is to use a compression strategy to compress and bundle web pages or api responses. The idea here is to shrink the results returned from a page or api back to the browser or client app. This optimizes network traffic and accelerating the web application. .NET has built in framework support for this technique with GZip compression. The reason this can dramatically impact scale is the network optimization benefit means less socket processing for the web server reducing web server cpu utilization, shortening connections, and thus allowing the web server to handle more concurrent requests.

      title: Use locking to ensure consistency.
      description: When using a relational database behind an Azure hosted application, the app owners must ensure an appropriate consistency and isolation level when making database connections to achieve maximum performance and scale out. Consistency and isolation are two of the ACID database properties. Consistency is all about ensuring a transaction can rollback to a state before the transaction started. Isolation is all about ensuring an executing transaction remains isolated from other executing transactions. The settings of these ACID properties can dramatically affect the number of users that can concurrently use a cloud web application in parallel, and therefore needs to be carefully considered across the various exposed web pages and/or APIs.

      title: Use async calls and waits to prevent locks.
      description: When an application calls a remote service leveraging a synchronous call, some of resources on the client (i.e caller thread, network socket, etc) are blocked and unavailable for use elsewhere until the remote service invocation completes. This pattern is simple, but leads to obvious inefficiencies. Asynchronous programming is an alternative approach that enables a remote service to be executed without waiting and blocking resources on the client. This is a critical pattern for enabling cloud scalable software and is available in most modern programming languages and platforms.

One could say that microservices refines and builds on the "component" patterns from the 1990's and early 2000's such as COM (Component Object Model) for breaking up logic into interface exposed modules. With the internet taking center stage, component models were combined with web protocols and transitioned into Service Oriented Architecture, and ultimately Web Services. Microservices is a type of web service that is particularly optimized for high scale requirements. This is because microsevices are designed to be independent with both deployment and versioning, and therefore can be scaled independently. So when combined with an orchestration platform designed to execute and manage microservices such as Kubernetes or Service Fabric, individual services can be right sized, scaled up, scaled down, and dynamically configured to match user demand. Additionally, microservices can be built and run using cloud serverless platforms such as Azure Functions that can dynamically scale with a pay-per-use model.

      title: Use queues.
      description: A variant to asynchronous programming discussed above, queuing services have long been used as a scalable mechanism to hand off processing work to a service. Called the Load Levelling pattern, highly scalable queuing services are natively supported in Azure. The queue is a storage buffer that sits between the caller and the processing service, takes requests, stores and queues the request, and provides services around the reliable delivery and management of the queued data. Queuing services have been in use for years with the likes of MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queue), MQSeries, and others; and cloud native  variants of queuing services have been part of Azure since its inception.

      title: Avoid sticky sessions and client affinity.
      description: To design a system to be horizontally scalable, avoid designing a web application that assumes requests have instance affinity. Stateless, or non-affinity applications, allow the hosting platform (App Services, Kubernetes, Service Fabric, other) to dynamically add or remove compute instances based on service metrics. This is called auto-scale and works differently depending on the service. A critical requirement for a web application or api to work in an auto-scalable environment is a stateless nature where the application saves its state to an external data store allowing the app platform to load-balance and route requests across the any of the clustered instances. This is advantageous for service self-healing, removing problematic compute instances, and enabling the latest platform innovation that leads to higher scale. For older applications running in App Services v1 platforms, avoid using the Application Request Routing (ARR) session affinity flag to force all requests back to the initial instance.

      title: Automatically scale when load increases.
      description: Many of the compute offerings in Azure offer auto-scale to ensure the right amount of resources are available mapping to service user demand. With auto-scale, your service can scale out to new compute instances during busy periods and scale back in during silent periods. This is critical for both the service user experience as well as offering cost savings for the service implementor. The way it works is metrics are collected for the resource (i.e. cpu, memory utilization) and the application (requests queued, requests per second). Rules can then be created off those metrics and/or time schedules to add/remove instances depending on how the rule evaluates. Many of the common Azure compute offerings support auto-scale. An App Services App Plan allows auto-scale rules to be set for scale-out and scale-in. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers two levels of auto-scale. Firstly, AKS provides horizontal auto-scale can be enabled on service containers to add more or less pod instances within the cluster. Secondly, AKS provides a cluster auto-scale on the agent VM instances running an agent node-pool to add more ore remove VM instances dynamically. Service Fabric has similar offerings and VM Scale Sets offers auto-scale capabilities for true IaaS scenarios. In addition, Azure App Gateway and Azure API Management are PaaS offerings for ingress services that also enable auto-scale. And lastly, Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and App Services offer serverless pay-per-use consumption modelling that inherently provide auto-scale.

      title: Use background jobs.
      description: Back in the 1990's and early 2000's, Enterprise Application Integration became a major topic for hooking systems together, creating and scheduling jobs and tasks. These platforms offered a series of connectors for working with common formats and protocols like EDI/X12/EDIFACT, SFTP, HL7, SWIFT, and SOAP; and managing long running processes that may span minutes/hours/days through workflow orchestration. Along with workflow, these integration tools solved app-to-app and business-to-business integration needs. Not surprisingly,these needs still exist in the cloud, but a scalable cloud native way of enabling these capabilities is paramount, and that's what the Logic Apps service enables in Azure. Logic Apps is a serverless consumption  (pay-per-use) service that enables a vast set of out-of-the-box ready-to-use connectors and a long-running workflow engine to quickly enable cloud-native integration needs. Logic Apps is flexible enough for a plethora of sceneries like running tasks/jobs, advanced scheduling, and triggering. It includes many of the format and protocol capabilities that existed in Microsoft's enterprise EAI product called BizTalk Server, and has advanced hosting options to allow it run within enterprise restricted cloud environments. Logic Apps compliments and can be combined with all other Azure services, or it can be used independently.

The application continues running without interruption as new resources are provisioned. When the provisioning process is complete, the solution is deployed on these additional resources. If demand drops, the additional resources can be shut down cleanly and deallocated.

      description: Divide the data across multiple databases and database servers, or design the application to use data storage services that can provide this partitioning transparently (examples include Azure SQL Database Elastic Database, and Azure Table storage). This approach can help to maximize performance and allow easier scaling. There are different partitioning techniques, such as horizontal, vertical, and functional. You can use a combination of these to achieve maximum benefit from increased query performance, simpler scalability, more flexible management, better availability, and to match the type of store to the data it will hold. Also, consider using different types of data store for different types of data, choosing the types based on how well they are optimized for the specific type of data. This may include using table storage, a document database, or a column-family data store, instead of, or as well as, a relational database.

      title: Minimize the load on the data store.
      description: The data store is commonly a processing bottleneck, a costly resource, and often not easy to scale out. Where possible, remove logic (such as processing XML documents or JSON objects) from the data store, and perform processing within the application. For example, instead of passing XML to the database (other than as an opaque string for storage), serialize or deserialize the XML within the application layer and pass it in a form that is native to the data store. It's typically much easier to scale out the application than the data store, so you should attempt to do as much of the compute-intensive processing as possible within the application.

      description: Data normalization helps to avoid duplication and inconsistency. However, maintaining multiple indexes, checking for referential integrity, performing multiple accesses to small chunks of data, and joining tables to reassemble the data imposes an overhead that can affect performance. Consider if some additional storage volume and duplication is acceptable in order to reduce the load on the data store. Also consider if the application itself (which is typically easier to scale) can be relied on to take over tasks such as managing referential integrity in order to reduce the load on the data store.

      title: Optimize database queries and indexes.
      description: Some T-SQL statements or constructs may have an adverse effect on performance that can be reduced by optimizing the code in a stored procedure. For example, avoid converting datetime types to a varchar before comparing with a datetime literal value. Use date/time comparison functions instead. Lack of appropriate indexes can also slow query execution. If you use an object/relational mapping framework, understand how it works and how it may affect performance of the data access layer.

This growth increases storage costs as well as latency when accessing the data, affecting application throughput and performance. It may be possible to periodically archive some of the old data that is no longer accessed, or move data that is rarely accessed into long-term storage that is more cost efficient, even if the access latency is higher.

      title: Track when resources scale in and out.
      description: Azure service scale in a variety of different ways, for example, App Services, ASE and VM ScaleSets can be configured with auto-scaling rules that can be based on several metrics including CPU, memory, bandwidth, etc. These rules can create new instances (scale in) or remove instances (scale in) or a running service. This capability can be enhanced by generating custom events from technologies like Application Insight that could be based on some other custom metrics. Azure Kubernetes Services offers both the ability to scale pods as well as to auto scale nodes. Scaling rules can be based on internal metrics or can leverage metrics from systems like Prometheus. Other services, such as Application Gateway, can be scaled manually. In this case, it is important to leverage services such as Log Analytics to raise alerts when the service is no longer able to handle the load.

For a given resource, there can be other resources that must exist before the resource is deployed. For example, a SQL server must exist before attempting to deploy a SQL database. You define this relationship by marking one resource as dependent on the other resource. Resource Manager evaluates the dependencies between resources, and deploys them in their dependent order.

      description: The term workload is typically defined as an arbitrary unit of functionality, such as an application or service. In the cloud a workload not only encompasses all the artifacts, but it also includes the cloud resources as well. This enables you to define a workload in terms of code artifacts and the necessary cloud resources, thus further enabling you to isolate workloads. You can isolate workloads by the way resources are organized, by network topology, or by other attributes. A basic workload is typically defined as a single web application or a virtual network (VNet) with virtual machine (VM).

      title: Manage and actively resolve the technical debt of the workload.
      description: Technical debt includes anything the team must do to deploy production quality code and keep it running in production. Examples are bugs, performance issues, operational issues, not having unit tests (necessary for refactoring code), accessibility, and others. SonarQube is a specific example of a tool that provides a set of static analyzers that can be used to identify areas of improvement in your code. It allows you to analyze the technical debt in your project and keep track of it in the future.

      title: Have pipelines for continuous deployment/continuous integration.
      description: Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. The key details to note are that you need to run code integration multiple times a day, every day, and you need to run the automated verification of the integration. What’s the motivation for this? Well, in the development process, the earlier we surface errors, the better. And one source of frequently occurring errors is the code integration step.

      title: Correlate events between the different application tiers.
      description: One critical advantage of Azure Monitor is that it is the monitoring tool for the whole Azure platform. As the previous sections has shown, Azure Monitor holds metrics and logs relevant to your application code, the platform where it is running, the data components, as well as the network connecting the application to its users. This enables operators to compare metrics of different application components to each other, and find out dependencies that might have been hidden otherwise. Dashboards in Azure offer an great way of exposing the rich information contained in Azure Monitor to other users. Make sure to create shared dashboards in order to expose relevant information to the different groups involved in operating your application, including Developers and Operators. If more complex visualizations are required, Azure Monitor data can be exported to PowerBI for advanced data analysis.

      title: Have a branching strategy and adhere to its requirements.
      description: Consider adopting a strategy that leverages features and release branches. Each new feature should reside in its own branch, which can be pushed to the central repository for backup/collaboration. But, instead of branching off of master, feature branches use develop as their parent branch. When a feature is complete, it gets merged back into develop. Features should never interact directly with master. Once develop has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), you fork a release branch off of develop.

      title: Install a web application firewall in front of your workload.
      description: Web application firewalls (WAFs) mitigate the risk of an attacker being able to exploit commonly seen security vulnerabilities for applications. While not perfect, WAFs provide a basic minimum level of security for web applications. WAFs are an important mitigation as attackers target web applications for an ingress point into an organization similar to a client endpoint. WAFs are appropriate for both organizations without a strong application security program and organizations who have invested in application security as WAFs provide a valuable additional defense in-depth mitigation.

      title: Authenticate via identity services where you can.
      description: Always authenticate with identity services rather than cryptographic keys when available. Managing keys securely with application code is difficult and regularly leads to mistakes like accidentally publishing sensitive access keys to code repositories like GitHub. Identity systems offer secure and usable experience for access control with built-in sophisticated mechanisms for key rotation, monitoring for anomalies, and more. Most organizations also have skilled teams dedicated to managing identity systems and few (if any) people actively managing key security systems.

      title: Evaluate your security posture using standard benchmarks.
      description: Use an industry standard benchmark to evaluate your organizations current security posture. Benchmarking allows you to improve your security program by learning from external organizations. Benchmarking lets you know how your current security state compares to that of other organizations, providing both external validation for successful elements of your current system as well as identifying gaps that serve as opportunities to enrich your team’s overall security strategy. Even if your security program isn’t tied to a specific benchmark or regulatory standard, you will benefit from understanding the documented ideal states by those outside and inside of your industry.

      title: Monitor identity risk.
      description: Monitor identity related risk events for warning on potentially compromised identities and remediate those risks. Most security incidents take place after an attacker initially gains access using a stolen identity. These identities can often start with low privileges, but the attackers then use that identity to traverse laterally and gain access to more privileged identities. This repeats as needed until the attacker controls access to the ultimate target data or systems.

      description: Protecting data at rest is required to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability assurances across all workloads. Storage in a cloud service like Azure is architected and implemented quite differently than on premises solutions to enable massive scaling, modern access through REST APIs, and isolation between tenants. Encryption at rest provides data protection for stored data (at rest). Attacks against data at-rest include attempts to obtain physical access to the hardware on which the data is stored, and then compromise the contained data. In such an attack, a server’s hard drive may have been mishandled during maintenance allowing an attacker to remove the hard drive. Later the attacker would put the hard drive into a computer under their control to attempt to access the data.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is the Azure solution for identity and access management. Azure AD is a multitenant, cloud-based directory and identity management service from Microsoft. It combines core directory services, application access management, and identity protection into a single solution.

When you centralize network management and security you reduce the potential for inconsistent strategies that can create potential attacker exploitable security risks. Because all divisions of the IT and development organizations do not have the same level of network management and security knowledge and sophistication, organizations benefit from leveraging a centralized network team’s expertise and tooling.

This will reduce confusion and resulting challenges with different technical teams (networking, identity, applications, etc.) each developing their own segmentation and delegation models that don’t align with each other. This leads to a straightforward and unified security strategy, which helps reduce the number of errors due to human error and inability to increase reliability through automation.

      description: Ensure technical controls can effectively prevent, detect, and respond to threats outside the networks you control. As organizations shift to modern architectures, many services and components required for applications will be accessed over the internet or on cloud provider networks, often by mobile and other devices off the network. Traditional network controls based on a *'trusted intranet'* approach will not be able to effectively provide security assurances for these applications. This shifting landscape is captured well by principles documented by the Jericho Forum and ‘Zero Trust’ approaches.

      title: Have an intentional subnet security strategy.
      description: Design virtual networks and subnets for growth. Most organizations end up adding more resources to their networks than they initially planned for. When this happens, IP addressing and subnetting schemes need to be refactored to accommodate the extra resources. This is a labor-intensive process. There is limited security value in creating a very large number of small subnets and then trying to map network access controls (such as security groups) to each of them. We recommend that you plan your subnets based on common roles and functions that use common protocols for those roles and functions. This allows you to add resources to the subnet without needing to make changes to security groups that enforce network level access controls.
