# Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

This is another reference to [^1]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

And another reference to [^longnote]

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

    > This is a block quote
    > Inside a footnote

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
