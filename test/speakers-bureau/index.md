## What is Speaker Bureau?

Speaker Bureau is a service that matches eligible speakers in key Microsoft technology areas to Microsoft event planners. Speakers will share their availability and interest in being contacted to speak at Microsoft events.

## What Events are covered?

Speaker Bureau will initially support technical skilling events for Azure, Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365. These events provide ongoing opportunities to connect in person with Microsoft local communities. All technical skilling events are consistent in design, audience and agenda, are free to attend, and are hosted around the world.

## How can I participate?

Signing up is easy. We will ask a few questions about yourself, the languages you speak, the technologies that you are comfortable presenting and your travel preferences. You will also have the opportunity to provide a link to a video showcasing your presentation skills.

That’s it! Once you’re signed up, you’ll be available to be contacted by a local event planner at Microsoft. Remember, you can always change your preferences or withdraw from the service.
