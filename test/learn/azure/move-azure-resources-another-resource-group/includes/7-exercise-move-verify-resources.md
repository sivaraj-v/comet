You've identified the development resources that are in the production resource group and you've checked that they'll move successfully. Now, you want to move your development resources from the production resource group into the dedicated development resource group. You can use the Azure portal to do so.

## Create a resource group for development resources

First you create the development resource group where you'll move your resources.

1. [Sign in](https://portal.azure.com/learn.docs.microsoft.com?azure-portal=true) to the Azure portal.
1. Select **Resource groups** > **Add**.
1. Enter "devgroup" in the resource group field.
1. Select **Next : Tags**.
1. Enter the following values:

    |Field |Value  |
    |---------|---------|
    |NAME    |   environment     |
    |VALUE     |  development      |

1. Select **Review + create** > **Create**.  

## Move development resources to the new group

Now that you've created a devgroup resource group, you can move your development resources into it.

1. At the top of the Azure portal, search on **tags**.
1. Select the **environment:development** tag.
1. Select the storage account that you want to move.
1. Select **Move** > **Move to another resource group**.

1. Under **Resource group**, select **devgroup**.
1. Select the reminder for you to update the resource IDs in your tools and scripts.
1. Select **OK**.

The move might take a few minutes. Wait for the notification that your resource has been moved. The notification will appear in the top-right hand of the portal.

Repeat this process again to move the other storage account.

To confirm that your move operations have succeeded:

1. On the Azure portal home page, select **Resource groups** > **devgroup**. 
1. You'll see that the development resources have been moved to the devgroup resource group.

In a real environment, you'd now update the resource IDs in any tools and scripts that reference your resources.
